Hotel campaigns is a new campaign type that enables advertisers to showcase their hotels on Bing.com across devices. Travelers can see [Hotel price ads](https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/ad-products/hotel-price-ads) when they are actively looking to book a hotel. In addition to the Hotel price ads, hotel campaigns allow advertisers to display their hotels on the Bing Maps page via the [property promotion ads](https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/ad-products/property-promotion-ads).

## Benefits

Here are some benefits of using Hotel campaigns:

* Streamlines Hotel price ads management across different platforms.

* Additional ad placements with the Property promotion ads.

* Increase your reach and online sales by using remarketing lists, including the ones that are already active in your Microsoft Advertising search campaigns and our in-market audience lists.

* Updated reporting to match reporting of other campaign types.

Coming early 2023:

* Additional ad distribution options include Microsoft Audience Network and other syndicated partners.

* Updated API to match search and retail API structure. (Only the web user interface version will be available prior to API enablement.)

Advertisers can run campaigns from both Hotel Center and Hotel campaigns, but youâ€™ll still need to upload feeds through the Hotel Center.

To use Hotel campaigns please follow the steps outlined in the [Hotel Price Ads Overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/advertising/hotel-ads/).
