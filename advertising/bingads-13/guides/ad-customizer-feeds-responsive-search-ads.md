## <a name="expandedtextad-examples"></a>Adding ad customizers to responsive search Ads

You can add ad customizers to these responsive search ad text fields: Headlines, Descriptions, and your Display URL's first and second paths (Path 1 and Path 2).

The ad customizer will appear in Microsoft Advertising in the following syntax: {CUSTOMIZER.Attribute name:default text}. So, if your attribute name is "Count" and your default text is "10," the syntax will be {CUSTOMIZER.Count:10}.
