>
> * Starting August 29, 2022, you will no longer be able to create new or edit existing expanded text ads. We strongly encourage you to create responsive search ads from now on.  
> * Existing expanded text ads will continue to serve, and youâ€™ll still be able to view reports on their performance.  
> * You'll be able to pause, enable, or remove your expanded text ads. Otherwise attempts to add or update expanded text ads will result in the `CampaignServiceAdTypeInvalid` error.
> * We recommend you have a minimum of one active responsive search ad for each standard ad group. For more information, see [Best practices for upgrading expanded text ads to responsive search ads.](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/ads/en/60037)
> * [Learn more about this change](https://about.ads.microsoft.com/blog/post/april-2022/deadline-for-migration-to-responsive-search-ads-extended-to-august-29-2022).
