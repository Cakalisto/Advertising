> * **Attention**: As of August 29, 2022, you can no longer create new or edit existing expanded text ads. **Please create at least one responsive search ad in each ad group**. For more information, see [Best practices for upgrading expanded text ads to responsive search ads](https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/ads/en/60037).
> * Existing expanded text ads will continue to serve, and you can still view reports on their performance.  
> * You can still pause, enable, or remove your expanded text ads. Otherwise, attempts to add or update expanded text ads will result in a `CampaignServiceAdTypeInvalid` error.
> * [Learn more about this change](https://about.ads.microsoft.com/blog/post/april-2022/deadline-for-migration-to-responsive-search-ads-extended-to-august-29-2022).
