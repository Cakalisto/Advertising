> [!NOTE]
>
> * Starting August 29, 2022, you will no longer be able to create or update existing expanded text ads (EXTAs).  
> * Existing expanded text ads will continue to serve, but we encourage you to upgrade them to [responsive search ads](../../../advertising/bingads-13/guides/responsive-search-ads.md).
> * Each standard ad group must have a minimum of one responsive search ad.
> * You can still get and delete, but can no longer create EXTAs or update existing EXTAs. One exception to the rule, is that you can still update the ExTAs status e.g. from Active to Paused. Otherwise attempts to add or update EXTAs will result in the *CampaignServiceAdTypeInvalid* error.
> * If you're planning on importing your responsive search ads from your Google Ads account, we recommend scheduling automatic imports to save you time.
> * [Learn more about this transition](https://about.ads.microsoft.com/blog/post/april-2022/deadline-for-migration-to-responsive-search-ads-extended-to-august-29-2022).
