> [!NOTE]
>
> * Starting August 29, 2022, you will no longer be able to create new or update existing expanded text ads.  
> * Existing expanded text ads will continue to serve, but we encourage you to upgrade them to [responsive search ads](../../../advertising/bingads-13/guides/responsive-search-ads.md).
> * Each standard ad group must have a minimum of one responsive search ad.
> * You will still be able to pause, enable, or delete your expanded text ads and view reports on their performance.  
> * If you're planning on importing your responsive search ads from your Google Ads account, we recommend scheduling automatic imports to save you time.
> * [Learn more about this transition](https://about.ads.microsoft.com/blog/post/april-2022/deadline-for-migration-to-responsive-search-ads-extended-to-august-29-2022).
